# Jaewons Insurance System
The system will be able to store information about clients and their policies.

The insurance company will use the system developed to manage their clients and policies. The system will be used by the insurance company’s staff to:

• Add new clients,
• Delete existing clients,
• Add new policies for existing clients,
• Calculate the cost of premiums for any given policy,
• Calculate the total cost of premiums for all policies for a client,
• Applying discounts for clients who have multiple policies.

Due to the insurance company’s limited budget (it’s apparently tough being an insurance company), the design used is a terminal-driven interface. This means that the system will be controlled by a menu system that will be displayed on the terminal. The menu will allow the staff member to select from a list of commands. The staff member will be able to select a command by typing its code, and any arguments it expects. Some commands require additional options, which the system prompts one at a time. The system will then execute the appropriate action. This was Programmed with Java.

To run:

1. Download all files
2. Open the folder directory on local computer and run this prompt in the command prompt/terminal.

`./mvnw clean compile exec:java@run`
